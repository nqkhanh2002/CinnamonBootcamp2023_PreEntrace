# Vietnamese ID Card Extractor

</div>

## Introduction
Vietnamese ID Card Extractor is an application that utilizes OCR technology to extract information from Vietnamese identification cards. It aims to provide a convenient way to extract data such as name, date of birth, gender, address, and ID number from scanned images or photos of Vietnamese ID cards.

## Technical Overview
The application is built using a combination of computer vision and natural language processing techniques. It leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms to recognize and extract text from the input images. The extracted text is then processed and analyzed to identify specific fields relevant to the ID card information.

The core technology behind the application involves training machine learning models on a dataset of Vietnamese ID card images to accurately recognize and extract the required information. The models are trained using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The application provides a user-friendly interface, allowing users to upload images of Vietnamese ID cards and retrieve the extracted information in a structured format. It supports various image formats, including JPEG and PNG.

## How to Install
To install and run the Vietnamese ID Card Extractor, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vietnamese-id-card-extractor.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory: 
```
cd vietnamese-id-card-extractor
```
4. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Run the application:
```
python main.py
```

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can access it through a web interface by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

1. Click on the "Upload" button to select an image of a Vietnamese ID card.

2. Wait for the application to process the image and extract the information.

3. The extracted information, including the name, date of birth, gender, address, and ID number, will be displayed on the screen.

4. You can repeat the process with other ID card images as needed.
